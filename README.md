### Majority Element
**Problem:** Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the majority element.  
**Solution:** Implements the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm.  
**Code:** [Link](./code/MajorityElement.cpp)

### Single Number
**Problem:** Find the single number in an array where every element appears twice except for one.  
**Solution:** Uses XOR for constant space and linear time complexity.  
**Code:** [Link](./code/SingleNumber.cpp)

### Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree
**Problem:** Convert a sorted array into a height-balanced binary search tree.  
**Solution:** Recursive approach to divide and conquer.  
**Code:** [Link](./code/SortedArrayToBST.cpp)

### Merge Two Sorted Lists
**Problem:** Merge two sorted linked lists into one sorted list.  
**Solution:** Recursive merging based on comparison.  
**Code:** [Link](./code/MergeTwoSortedLists.cpp)

### Linked List Cycle
**Problem:** Detect if a linked list contains a cycle.  
**Solution:** Uses Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm.  
**Code:** [Link](./code/LinkedListCycle.cpp)

### Pascal's Triangle
**Problem:** Generate Pascal's Triangle for a given number of rows.  
**Solution:** Dynamic programming to calculate rows iteratively.  
**Code:** [Link](./code/PascalsTriangle.cpp)

### Remove Element
**Problem:** Remove duplicates in-place in a sorted array.  
**Solution:** Two-pointer approach to maintain order.  
**Code:** [Link](./code/RemoveElement.cpp)

### Baseball Game
**Problem:** Calculate the score of a baseball game based on operations.  
**Solution:** Stack-based approach for scorekeeping.  
**Code:** [Link](./code/BaseballGame.cpp)

### Remove Linked List Elements
**Problem:** Remove all nodes from a linked list that have a specific value.  
**Solution:** Iterates through the list using a dummy node for simplicity.  
**Code:** [Link](./code/RemoveLinkedListElements.cpp)

### Reverse Linked List
**Problem:** Reverse a singly linked list.  
**Solution:** Iterative approach with three pointers.  
**Code:** [Link](./code/ReverseLinkedList.cpp)

### Container With Most Water
**Problem:** Find two lines that form a container holding the most water.  
**Solution:** Two-pointer approach for linear time complexity.  
**Code:** [Link](./code/ContainerWithMostWater.cpp)

### Valid Sudoku
**Problem:** Validate a partially filled Sudoku board.  
**Solution:** Hashing to track rows, columns, and subgrids.  
**Code:** [Link](./code/ValidSudoku.cpp)

### Jump Game II
**Problem:** Find the minimum number of jumps to reach the last index.  
**Solution:** Greedy algorithm for optimal jumps.  
**Code:** [Link](./code/JumpGameII.cpp)

### Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node
**Problem:** Populate each node’s next pointer in a perfect binary tree.  
**Solution:** Iterative traversal at each level.  
**Code:** [Link](./code/PopulatingNextRightPointers.cpp)

**Problem:** Maximize the number of groups served with fresh donuts.  
**Solution:** Dynamic programming and modular arithmetic.  
**Code:** [Link](./code/MaxGroupsFreshDonuts.cpp)

### Maximum Number of Darts Inside a Circular Dartboard
**Problem:** Find the maximum darts within a dartboard of a given radius.  
**Solution:** Geometry-based calculations.  
**Code:** [Link](./code/DartsInsideDartboard.cpp)

### Find Minimum Time to Finish All Jobs
**Problem:** Assign jobs to minimize the maximum working time of any worker.  
**Solution:** Binary search with backtracking.  
**Code:** [Link](./code/MinTimeToFinishJobs.cpp)
